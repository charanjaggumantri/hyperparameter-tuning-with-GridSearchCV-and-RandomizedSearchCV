# hyperparameter-tuning-with-GridSearchCV-and-RandomizedSearchCV

1.Import Libraries: First, import all the necessary libraries for loading data, training models, and performing the hyperparameter tuning.
2.Load the Dataset: For demonstration, you can use the Iris dataset, but this can be replaced with any dataset you are working on.
3.Split the Dataset: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
4.Train a Machine Learning Model (e.g., Random Forest): Start by training a model with default hyperparameters.
5.Hyperparameter Tuning with GridSearchCV: Now, perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
6.Hyperparameter Tuning with RandomizedSearchCV (Alternative): If you want to use RandomizedSearchCV instead of GridSearchCV, which can be more efficient for large hyperparameter spaces
7.Comparison of Model Performance: Compare the model performance with default hyperparameters and tuned hyperparameters.
